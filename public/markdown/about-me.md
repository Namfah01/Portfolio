# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm an ambitious [full-stack developer](http://linkedin.com/in/kanokwan-manachamni) leveraging a diverse background to drive innovation in software development.

I recently completed an intensive 14-week coding bootcamp at [Generation Thailand](https://thailand.generation.org/programs/jsd/), focusing on full-stack web development. Prior to this, I worked as a Physical Therapist at [Cryo Thailand](https://www.cryo.com/th/localized-cryotherapy/), where I honed my problem-solving and analytical skills.

I'm passionate about creating impactful solutions and excel in collaborative environments.

My background in [physical therapy](https://pt.medicine.psu.ac.th) has given me a unique perspective on managing complex systems, which I now apply to software architecture and development.

I'm committed to continuous learning and strive for excellence in [every project](https://github.com/Namfah01) I undertake.

My technical skills span both front-end and back-end technologies, including [JavaScript](), [React.js](), [Node.js](), [Express.js]() and [MongoDB](). I'm also exploring AI integration and prompt engineering.
